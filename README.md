# Tenth C++ Assignment  

## Concepts: [STL Containers, Iterators, Sorting Algorithms, Data Processing]  

In this tenth assignment, we had to:  
- Implement a **Bitcoin Exchange** program to process and evaluate cryptocurrency prices using **STL containers**  
- Create a **Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) calculator**, handling expressions with a stack-based approach  
- Develop **PmergeMe**, a sorting algorithm based on the **Ford-Johnson merge-insertion sort**, using two different STL containers for performance comparison  

This assignment reinforced **efficient use of STL containers, custom algorithms, and data processing techniques** in C++.
